#Programming Portfolio

This portfolio showcases some of the projects that I completed in the Udacity program. The portfolio was one of the projects that was given at beginning of the Udacity program. Since completing the program, I wanted to revisit the project and to update it. But  I decided to rewrite the portfolio using my other portfolio project a base. This portfolio uses backbone and underscore.
