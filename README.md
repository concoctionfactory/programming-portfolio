#Programming Portfolio

This portfolio showcases some of the projects that I completed in the Udacity program. Since the portfolio was one of the projects that was given at beginning of the Udacity program, I wanted to revisit the project to update it. But I decided to rewrite the portfolio using my other portfolio project as a base. This portfolio also uses backbone and underscore.
